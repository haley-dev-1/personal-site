        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> This webpage acts as my resume, but expanded and interactive. </p>
        <p> I created this site with the hopes of displaying that I not only want to advance as an engineer, but I'd like to take an opportunity to teach people, lead, and educate. </p>
        <p> I hope to use this page to convey my work ethic, passion for projects, and personality! </p>
        <p> Thank you for taking the time to look at my work!</p>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Multimodal Data Fusion for Emotion Recognition</h3>
            <p>CSCE790 • Neuromorphic & Edge Computing • Spring 2025</p>
            <p>Group final project. Applied knowledge of convolutional neural networks, real-time systems, and data fusion techniques.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-card">
            <h3>IPC Messaging</h3>
            <p>CSCE311 • Operating Systems • Fall 2024</p>
            <p>Description</p>

            <h3>Multithreaded two-way group chat</h3>
            <p>CSCE491 • Computer Networks • Fall 2024</p>
            <p>Implemented a group chat system on the command line. TCP sockets were used to ensure reliable and orderly messaging. Due to multiple clients being allowed, they were tracked using a hashmap.</p>
        </div>

         <div class="project-card">
            <h3>Analysis of RC and RLC Filters</h3>
            <p>ELCT221 • Circuits II • Spring 2024 </p>
            <p>Group lab project. Used circuits and breadboards to create RC lowpass, RC highpass, and RLC Bandpass filters. Simulated each circuit configuration on LTSpice, and compared real vs. simulation. 
                Analog Discovery's WaveForms software was used to display oscilloscope results. Our group analyzed magnitude and phase transfer plots for each circuit, as well as their corner frequency.</p>

            <h3>Up/Down Un/Sat Counter</h3>

            <p>CSCE211 • Digital Logic Design • Fall 2023</p>
            <p>One of my personal favorite projects. This furthered my excitement for pursuing ECE.</p>
            
            <p>Group project, cumulative from other gorup projects throughout the semester. We were tasked to create, from scratch (and handwritten karnaugh maps), a base-ten counter. 
                The user could toggle whether the counter would saturate or not, or whether it'd count up or down. </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a computer engineer with a passion for embedded systems and machine learning. I’ve worked on many projects, 
            spanning from real-time systems to ... </br>
            I have a background with full-stack development. I technically began this journey in elementary school when I took it upon myself to learn HTML, and eventually CSS.
            I aspire to get into embedded systems, robotics, and system design.
