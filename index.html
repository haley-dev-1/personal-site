        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> This webpage acts as my resume, but expanded and interactive. </p>
        <p> I created this site with the hopes of displaying that I not only want to advance as an engineer, but I'd like to take an opportunity to teach people, lead, and educate. </p>
        <p> I hope to use this page to convey my work ethic, passion for projects, and personality! </p>
        <p> Thank you for taking the time to look at my work!</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a computer engineer with a passion for embedded systems and machine learning. I’ve worked on many projects, 
            spanning from real-time systems to ... </br>
            I have a background with full-stack development. I technically began this journey in elementary school when I took it upon myself to learn HTML, and eventually CSS.
            I aspire to get into embedded systems, robotics, and system design.
